                <h6>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects,
                    including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm
                    to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. <br />
                    1.User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook. <br />
                    2.Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed using either a secret salt or a private key. <br />
                    3.User's Client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP Authorization header. <br />
                    4.Resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key. <br />
